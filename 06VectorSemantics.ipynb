common similarity metric, it takes two vectors of size len(V) x len(V) (len(V) x len(D) is term-document) and gives a measure of their similarity. It's based in the dot product. The dot product acts as a similarity metric because it'll tend to be high when two vectors have the same values in the same dimensions, but it favours long vectors, it's higher if the vector is longer. The dot product will be higher for frequent words. Because of that the vector must be normalized by dividing the dot product by the magnitude of both vectors. Vectors can be pre normalized by dividing by its magnitude.\n","\n","This measure of similarity depends on the angle that is formed from both vectors, which is 0 if they are identical vectors or 90 if they are orthogonal vectors. Cosine can be used to measure the angle that two vectors form, similar to a normal 2dimensional angle, cosine tells how similar their direction is from 90º to 0, being 0 if it's 90 degrees or 1 if it's 0 degrees.\n","\n","The cool thing about this is the fact that we can also make operations with this vectors, usually with Word2vec embeddings, to find or represent semantic relations.

Instead of sparse vectors embeddings are dense, meaning that they have much less zeroes, and the values inside these embeddings are real valued numbers that can be negative. This vectors work much better than the sparse, long ones. Word2vec methods are fast, efficient to train and easily available online.\n","\n","Word2vec embeddings are static embeddings, meaning that the method learns one fixed embedding for each word. Instead of counting how often a word occurs near another it trains a classifier on a binary prediction task \"is *w* likely to appear near *c*?\" We don't care about this prediction, but we'll use the weights as the word embeddings. We can use running text as implicitly supervised training data for such a classifier: a word *c* that occurs near a target word *w* acts as gold to that question. This method is called self-supervision. It uses ogistic regression and simplifies the task by makin a binary clasification.\n","\n","### Skip-gram with negative sampling or SGNS\n","\n","SNGS is one of the two algorithms in the Word2vec software pack and it's sometimes referred as the Word2vec algorithm. The goal is to train a classifier such that, given a tuple (w, c) it'll return the probability that *c* is a real context word: P( + | w, c). the probability that *c* is not a real context word for *w* is: 1 - P( + | w, c).\n","\n","The idea is to base this probability on embedding similarity, a word is likely to occur near words with similar embeddings, meaning we can use the dot product of the two embeddings, if the dot product is high it means they are similar. To turn the result in a probability we can use the sigmoid function, but for it to be a probability all probabilities must sum to one, meaning that P( + | w, c) = 1 - P( - | w, c). To calculate the probability of all context words in the window we make the assumption that all context words are independent, which means we can just multiply their probabilities.\n","\n","Skipgram trains a probabilistic classifier that, given a target word and its context window, assigns a probability based on how similar this context window is to the target word. To compute this probability we just need the embeddings for each target and context word. Skipgram actually stores two embeddings fo each word, one of the word as a target and one of the word as a context word. Thus the paramepers we need to learn are the two matrices W and C, each containing an embedding for every word in the vocabulary.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"dSfmejXM11Ax"}}]}
